# Day one doc

### This semester we will be building a web application called "The Todo App". It will track personal tasks and
categorize them as either not started, in progress, or completed. You can also assign due dates and different
categories (i.e. school, fun, family, etc.) to your todos. Since we prepared this course to accommodate all levels
of students, we will start assuming the student has no knowledge of programming. Seeing as we are starting from scratch,
we will teach the basics of programming in Python, using functions and classes, object oriented programming concepts, and
then begin working with HTML/CSS and Javascript. Our final project will use programming languages including HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python. We look forward to embarking on this journey with you to learning programming and app development!

0. We use certain typings that allow us to convey information to the user.

- Text wrapped in backticks `` (they are generally found in the top left of a keyboard along with the tilda "~")
should be directly copied and pasted. For example, `mkdir programming` as shown below would be directly copied and
pasted into your terminal window.

- Text wrapped in square brackets [] are meant to be replaced with text specific to the user. That text will be
described in the brackets. For example, if you wanted to change directories using the "cd" command, you could
enter the following `cd [directory name]`. If that directory was named "py-files", your command would look like
this- `cd py-files`. As you can see, the brackets are removed when you are inserting your own text.

- Text wrapped in double quotes is a reference to some text, or an action that should be taken by the user. These
are typically self-explanatory.

1. Download Python -> https://www.python.org/downloads/
        a. IMPORTANT: Check off the "Add to Path" box when installing

2. Create a Github Account -> github.com
        a. Download Git -> https://git-scm.com/downloads
  
3. Download VS Code -> https://code.visualstudio.com/download
        
4. Create a folder named "programming" in your computer's "Documents" directory.
  
5. Open a new window in VS Code. Click "Open Folder". Find your programming folder. Click it once then click "Open".
        a. To open a terminal in VS Code click "Shift + Ctrl + `"
        b. Enter the command `pwd` into your terminal then click enter. Your "working directory" should
           be in the "programming" folder, and the path response you get from the pwd command should end in "programming"
           (i.e. user/Documents/programming)
        c. Create a folder called "python-work" by entering the command `mkdir python-work`
        d. Download the following VS Code extensions- Python and TODO Highlight. You can find the extensions tab in VS
           Code by clicking "Shift + Ctrl + X" (windows) or "Shift + Command + X" (mac). Once there, search for those exact extensions and download the first result for each of them. Once you are done downloading those extensions, return back to the main "Explorer" page where you will be viewing your folders/files by clicking "Shift + Ctrl + E" (windows) or "Shift + Command + E" (mac).
        
6. Create a repository in Github -> https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/creating-a-new-repository
        Then copy this set of commands into your terminal after creating repository:
          - `echo "# [INSERT REPOSITORY NAME]" >> README.md`
          - `git init`
          - `git add README.md`
          - `git commit -m "first commit"`
          - `git remote add origin [REPOSITORY URL]`
          - `git push -u origin master`
          
7. To check what your working directory is once again, enter `pwd` into your terminal

8. When you want to go up a level in your directory, enter `cd ..` into your terminal
    ex: if you are in "/Users/user/Documents/programming/python-work"
        Enter in the Terminal: `cd ..`
        your working directory will then be "/Users/username/Documents/programming"

9. When you want to chamge your working directory, enter `cd [directory name]`
        For example, if you are in "/Users/username/Documents/programming"
        Enter in the Terminal: `cd python-work` (If you begin to type the name of the desired directory,
                                                 you can hit the tab button and the directory should fill in)
        your working directory will then be "/Users/username/Documents/programming/python-work"
        
10. The steps to commit code to Github are:
        `git add .`
        `git commit -m "commit message`
        `git push`
        
11. To pull code from the master branch of a repository:
        `git pull origin master`
        
12. Next you should copy and paste the todos (file ends in "todo") into VS Code
        a. Go to -> https://github.com/projectinnovatenewark/student_repository/tree/master/todos
           to see the assignment files separated by week.
        b. Create a file in your 'python-work' folder in VS Code:
           right click on 'python-work' folder
           click 'new file'
           name the new file 'currentlesson.py' (.py tells VS Code that it is a pthon file)
        c. Copy the first lesson from week one in your new file and try to solve it. 
           To run your code, simply click on the green arrow at the top right of your VS Code window.
 
13. When you are finished with the lesson and complete the corresponding todo
          (todo's are meant to test what you learned from the lesson)
        a. repeat step 12.b but instead name the file 'currentlessontodo.py'
        b. try to complete the todo and then peer review
