Modify the example from week 3 lesson 3's game function
"""

# This example is from a previous lesson. We want it to ask a user how many times they want
# to play the game, play the game that many times, and tell them when they guess correctly
# along the way. One thing though- the example from the lessons doesn't account for if a user
# inputs something thats NaN (not a number). Implement a try-except to address if the user
# gets a ValueError from entering a non-number. This should probably happen in the inquireUserGames
# function as well as the playTheGame function to ensure that any time a user input is made,
# your function can account for non-number entries. You may use either a try-except-finally
# or a try-except-else to work through the solution.

# Original Lesson Solution:
from random import randint
