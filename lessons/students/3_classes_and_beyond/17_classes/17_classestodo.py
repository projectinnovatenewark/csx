# TODO: Create a class for an Employee, and include basic data
# TODO: like hours worked, salary, first name, last name, age, and title


# TODO: Create a function inside the class and print out a formatted
# TODO: set of strings explaining the details from the employee. Use the f shorthand
# TODO: for formatting that was used in the previous example.

# TODO: Then, call that function to print out those strings with a class
# TODO: of Employee set equal to a variable employeeOne



# TODO: Set up a child class that derives from the Employee class and add the attribute 'h_benefits'.
# TODO: Define a function 'intro' to print:
# TODO: "Hi, my name is Garrett Palmeri. I am 24 year old Financial Analyst that makes $40000 per year.
# TODO: I do not have insurance."



# TODO: Create a class named 'Animal' with the attributes no_of_legs, weight, height 



# TODO: Then you will create 2 classes derived from 'Animal' named 'Mammal' and 'Fish' 
# TODO: Define the variable 'habit' for 'Mammal' and 'Fish' to = 'Land' and 'Water' respectively,
# TODO: so that it will apply to all Mammals and Fish.
# TODO: Also give 'Mammal' a new attribute - 'can_fly' 



# TODO: Then set the class 'Dog' derived from 'Mammal' and 'Shark' derived from 'Fish'.
# TODO: Give a new attribute to each - 'd_type' and 's_type' respectively.



# TODO: Define a function in 'Dog' that prints the statement
# TODO: "Golden Retriever: 4 legs, 65 lbs, 47 inches. Habitat: Land"
# TODO: Define a function in 'Shark' that prints the statement
# TODO: "Great White: 0 legs, 2100 lbs, 144 inches. Habitat: Water"
# TODO: Print each statement
