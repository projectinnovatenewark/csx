# TODO: Section 1

# Create a class for an "Employee" that includes the instance attributes: "first_name", "last_name",
# "salary", and "title".



# Next, within the "Employee" class, create a method called "printer()" that prints the statement,
# "[first_name] [last_name] works as a [title] and makes $[salary] per year."
# IMPORTANT: Use f shorthand to format your print statement.



# Then, define a new instantion of "Employee" with "first_name" equal to "Spongebob", "last_name"
# equal to "Squarepants", "salary" equal to "50000" and "title" equal to "Fry Cook"



# Lastly, call the "printer()" method to print your formatted statement.

# write a method called "add_power()" that adds a new superpower to the "powers" list.

class SuperHero:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.powers = []

  # FIXME: Write your method here.



# Then, define a new instantiation of "SuperHero" with the "name" equal to "Superman" and store it
# in a variable called "super".



# Next, call the "add_power()" method three times to add the superpowers: "heat vision",
