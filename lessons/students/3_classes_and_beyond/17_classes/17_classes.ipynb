    "# TITLE: Section 1.1 - Constructing Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "# As we have covered previously, Python is an object oriented programming (OOP) language. Therefore,\n",
    "# almost everything in Python is an object. An object consists of various data and the methods that\n",
    "# perform operations on those data. Python implements certain types of object constructors\n",
    "# inherently, such as when a user defines a string. When you set a variable equal to a string,\n",
    "# Python constructs an object of the type \"str\" for string. The string class has methods that\n",
    "# you can perform on the variable, such as \".upper()\" to convert every character to uppercase.\n",
    "# As you can see, classes are a key component of Python and you've been exposed to these concepts\n",
    "# since Lesson 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The primary point of this lesson is to understand how to create our own types of objects.\n",
    "# To create user-defined objects in Python, we can use an object constructor known as a \"class\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both objects and classes are comprised of attributes and methods. There are two types of\n",
    "# attributes; class attributes and instance attributes. Class attributes are shared by all\n",
    "# instances of a class while instance attributes are specific to a given instance of a class.\n",
    "# Methods are functions defined within the scope of and bound to classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The syntax for constructing a custom class is \"class ClassName:\". Below is an example of creating\n",
    "# a class called \"TenClass\".\n",
    "\n",
    "class TenClass: # Class names use \"TitleCase\" as opposed to either \"camelCase\" or \"snake_case\".\n",
    "  x = 10 # This is a class attribute - all instances of \"TenClass\" will have this attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "  def x_plus_five(self): \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This is a method. Methods always set at least one parameter of self to\n",

    "    \n",
    "    # We use \"self\" to print a given instance's value of x + 5.\n",
    "    print(f\"x_plus_five called: {self.x + 5}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Just as other means of storing values in variables, we can create an instance of the \"TenClass\"\n",
    "# class and store it in a variable.\n",
    "instance1 = TenClass()\n",
    "instance2 = TenClass()\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can access class methods and attributes by using dot (.) notation. Below is an example of\n",
    "# manually printing each instance's \"x\" attribute. Since \"x\" is a class attribute, it will have the\n",
    "# same value for each instance of \"TenClass\".\n",
    "print(f\"instance1: {instance1.x}\")\n",
    "print(f\"instance2: {instance2.x}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Below is an example of using dot notation to call the \"x_plus_five()\" method.\n",
    "# IMPORTANT: The instance object is read as the first argument of \"self\" in the method call, so it\n",
