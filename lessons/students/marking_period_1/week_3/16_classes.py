Understanding classes and scope within a class
"""

# The variable Cat could have been named anything. The "Cat()" says to
# create a new object and to run the strangely named function __init__ (two
# underscores before and after 'init').
# __init__ is a special Python function that it is called automatically on an object
# creation statement. The computer science term for it is constructor, as its
# job is to build an object of the type specified by the class.
# The 'self' parameter in __init__ just refers to the instance being created, in
# this case Cat. __init__ creates the object, putting in default values for all the
# fields, then returns the object into the variable Cat. The main program then
# goes on to set the various fields of the Cat object, and then access and print
# one of them. Note that the fields of an object can be set/accessed with a
# reference of the form:
# object.field
​
# As shown below, we also pass an inital value into the object Cat(). We then set
# the input to "name" inside the init constructor and set the Cat's name value
# to the input it receives
​
# For more info on classes, refer to the Python docs:
# https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html

​
# this will create two new instances of a Cat class with the self.names of Fido and Bella
d = Cat('Fido')

​
# since kind is declared for all cats, the kind will be shared by both Fido and Bella

# Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming.

# It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. 
# The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from 
# which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.

# Take the below class.

# it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.
# Then you can see we are adding Graduation year to the attributes of the Student class.
