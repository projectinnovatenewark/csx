# let's remember something when using a nested for loop here. The first iteration of our
# top level for loop would be "Season 1" since it is the first key in our dictionary. You
# might want to set a variable between the top level for loop and the nested loop. Remember,
# if the iteration of each loop is a key, that variable you'd set between loops should follow
# the format of variableName = dictionaryName[keyName]. Then, you can iterate through that new
# variable, since it should equal the value of the key which is a dictionary.
# TODO: Question 4: Create a nested for loop that would list an output for each episode
# TODO: that would state "Episode __ of Season __ is titled '____' "
