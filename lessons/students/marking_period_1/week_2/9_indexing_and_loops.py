"""
Indexing and range function for lists, dictionaries, strings and numbers
"""

# for loops iterate through something that is passed to it. What it does with that item is specified
# in the loop. Each time the control is passed through the loop is called an "iteration".

# for ranges, the variable you set will be equal to the number in the range,
# starting with the lower bound of that range.

# for lists, the variable will iterate through each item in the list, starting with the first item.

# for dictionaries, the variable will represent each iterate through each key,
# starting with the first key.

####################################################################################################

# "for x in range(y)" is a loop that would iterate through every number from zero up until the
# given number of "y". When there is only one number passed to the range() function, the "lower bound" of
# that range would default to zero. The "upper bound", which in the case below is 9, would NOT be
# included. In the loop, each iteration will assign itself the variable `num`. For the first iteration
# of this for loop, zero would be assigned to num. In the second iteration, num would be
# assigned one (and so on).
print("range 9 loop: ")
for num in range(9):
    print(num)

####################################################################################################

# If you put in an initial argument, that number is included in the range and would be the
# "lower bound". The second number would be the "upper bound", and therefore not included
# in the loop.
print("range 3, 11 loop: ")
for num in range(3, 11):

# Index lists with for loops.

# Recall: if you want to concatenate a number into a string, convert it to a string by wrapping
# it with the str() function.

# Lets show how a for loop works with lists. This loop will "iterate" over each number. Each
# item in the list will iterated over in this loop.
for num in grades:

print("End of first for loop. \n")

# Now, lets make it readable! Add one to the index number so it starts at one instead of zero
# to find the index of an element in a list, use the index function as shown below. The index
# function will return an item's index value within the list, in the
# format of `idx = list_name.index(item_name)`

# Lets make reading grades easier by attaching them to the name of the student that got the grade
# when you use a for loop, it will return each key in the dictionary. You can access the value
# by indexing the dictionary using dictionary[key] to find that key's value

print("Chris got a " + str(grades["Chris"]))

# When you use a for loop with a dictionary, the variable gets set to every key, NOT the value :)
# It is important to understand
# that functions and loops use a colon and work within a 'scope', or whatever falls within the
# tabulation set by the line thereafter. We use four spaces in one tab to denote that certain code
# falls within a function

# The way that a for loop/while loop decides to continue running is if it evaluates a condition
# as true. We will go over what is considered "True" for different types of iterable
# data (i.e. lists, dicts, range) using loops.

# This will continue to run until all the items have been removed with the .pop method
# and your list is empty. An empty list equates to a False condition, and the loop will end.

# "continue" statement:
# The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop
# and moves the control back to the top of the loop.

# In this example, we provide a sneak peak at a conditional. The condition we are using is an "if"
# condition. That just means "if the following condition is true, then do something within the scope
# of this statement". While we also haven't really addressed scope, just know that everything following
# the if statement that is tabbed inward represents the scope of that if statement.
# Example:
if (str(5) == '5'):
    print('this is in the scope of the if statement')
    print('this would also be in the scope of the if statement')

print('this would NO LONGER be in the scope of the if statement')

# The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops.

# this would execute after the while loop is done running.
print("Good bye!") # since this tabulation is set to the same spacing as the while loop,
                   # this print statement won't run until the while loop is complete.

# You can see that custom conditions can be placed in a while loop, too. We can check for the following conditions:
# "x == y" (x is equal to y); "x != y" (x is NOT equal to y); "x > y" (x is greater than y); "x >= y" (x is greater than or equal to y);
# "x < y"(x is less than y); "x <= y" (x is less than or equal to y); "x in y" (x exists in y- often y represents a list here);
# "x not in y" (x does not exist in y); and we can combine conditions such as "x < y and x != z" (x is less than y AND x does not equal z)
