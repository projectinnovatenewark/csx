# Here is a new concept we haven't covered yet- constants! Constants are like variables,
# but they are typed in all caps and don't change! Variables can be manipulated and change,
# whereas constants must remain the same.

# For example, the corporate tax rate is 20%. Hence, that would be an example of a constant
# you will also see for company profit we use the int() function, which converts items to the
# type of integer.
company_profit = int(input("How much money did your company make this year?: "))
CORPORATE_TAX_RATE = .20
taxes_paid = company_profit * CORPORATE_TAX_RATE

# Wait, you can't concatenate floats and strings!! lets use the str() function with the
# "taxes_paid" variable to make the output work.
print("I paid " + str(taxes_paid) + " dollars in taxes for my business")

# If you do calculations between a integer and float, the output is a float.
summation = 3 + 3.0 # Summation will now equal 6.0

# Let's say you want to add to the variable summation. You want to increment it by one, for
# whatever reason. There's one way to do this that is ugly, not fun, and definitely not cool üõë.
# Lets do it that way first.
summation = summation + 1 # Summation will now be 7.0

# Using += will add whatever value comes after to the variable, then reassign the variable
# to that new value. Since summation was 7.0 and we use += 2, the value of summation after
# this line will be 9.0
# LETS. MAKE. IT. BETTER üî•
summation += 2 # summation will now equal 9.0

# Formatting is important for numbers if you want to specify an output. By using the percent
# sign below and .2f, you specify that the variable "summation", which follows the string, will
# have two decimal points.
print("The sum of our int and float, after incrementing it a bit, is %.2f" %summation)

number_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# min() finds the minimum of a set of numbers
print(min(number_list))

# max() finds the max of a set of numbers
print(max(number_list))

# sum() adds numbers together if you're either:
#   a) too lazy to put plus signs between everything
#   b) have a super long list that makes your head spin
#   c) both of the above
print(sum(number_list))

# abs() finds the absolute value
print(abs(150))

# The absolute value of a negative number is the positive of that number
print(abs(-43))

# The absolute value of a float is the positive of that number including the decimal values
print(abs(-43.5))

# We also have the math package/module from python. Python has a built in tool that we
# can import and use to help us in mathematical operations. Normally imports go at the
# TOP of a file, but we will put it here to consolidate the lesson.

import math

# Now that we have the math package imported, we can use methods attached to the module. One
# such method we can import is is pow() üëäüèø. This is used to check a mathematical power.
# For example, pow(3, 3) would be three raised to the third power, which is 27.

doing_math_pow = math.pow(3, 3)

# The ** exponent is the equivalent of the above.
doing_math_exp = 3**3

print('Here is the output of the math module example: ', doing_math_pow)
print('Here is regular 3**3 without the math package: ', doing_math_exp)

# As you can see, the math package result returns a float whereas the normal math
# operation returned an integer. Nothing interesting here, just a lil' note.
