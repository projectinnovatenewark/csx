# TODO: Section 1

# Generate a user input asking for an integer and store it in a variable called "num". Then write a
# function called "evaluate()" that tells the user whether "num" is an odd or even number.

# The defined function should take a parameter called "user_input" and print the statement "The user
# input is even." if the input is even, or "The user input is odd." if the input is odd. Lastly, use
# "num" as the argument to call "evaluate()".

# TODO: Section 2

# Define a function called "charLength()" with a parameter called "string". Store the length of
# "string" in a variable called "string_len".
 
# TIP: The "len()" function learned for finding the length of lists can be used for strings as well.

# If the length of "string" is greater than 10, the function should print "The string [string] has
# more than 10 characters." If the previous condition is false, but the length of the string is
# greater than 5, print the statement "The string [string] has more than 5 characters." If both
# conditions are false, print "The string [string] only has [string_len] characters." Call the
# function for each of the 3 variables defined below.

stringy1 = "racecar"
stringy2 = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
stringy3 = ""

# TODO: Section 3

# Write a "while loop" that increments the variable "i" by 3 and prints "i" in each iteration. The
# "while loop" should run as long as "i" is less than 30. If "i" is an even number, print the
# statement "Skipping number [i]." and execute a continue statement to move the control back to the
# top of the loop.

i = 0

# TODO: Section 4

# Write a "while loop" that incements the variable "i" by 4 in each iteration. The "while loop"
# should run as long as "i" is less than 200 and print "i" in each iteration. If "i" is a greater
# than 42, print the statement "Breaking the loop now." and implement a break statement to stop the
# loop from running.
