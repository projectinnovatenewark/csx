# Run the below code to find the error, then comment out the code
# and rewrite it with a new denominator to fix the error. Then print the 
# type of error you got from the original problem.

number = 10 * (1/0) # FIXME

# TODO: Section 1.1:
# Again, run the code below to find what type of error you are encountering. Then
# define 'spam' as a variable and print your error type.

equation = 4 + spam*3 # FIXME

# TODO: Section 1.2:
# Again, run the code below to find what type of error you are encountering.
# Change the code so that our '2 + 2' addition works and print your original error type.

four = '2' + 2 # FIXME
