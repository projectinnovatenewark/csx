# Import the annual_interest and TAX_RATE constants from the file "interest.py" in
# studentrepository/todos/1_basics

# Ask a user how much they would like to invest with an input. Set it equal to a variable
# named "investment".
# TIP: Don't forget to convert the input to an integer!

# Calculate how much their investment would appreciate in one year by multiplying
# the investment variable by the annual_interest. Set the appreciation amount
# equal to a variable named "appreciation".

# TODO: Section 1.1

# Create a new variable named "new_value" by adding the "appreciation" variable to the
# "investment" variable.

# Calculate the taxes you have to pay by setting a variable of "taxes" equal to
# the "appreciation" variable times the TAX_RATE.

# Print to the user the following output using f shorthand: "Your investment of {investment} is now worth
# {new_value} and you owe {taxes} in taxes."
