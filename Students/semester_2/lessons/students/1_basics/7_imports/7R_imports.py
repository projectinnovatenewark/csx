# TODO: Hey Teacher, have the students create their own "importable_stuff.py" within the same folder
# TODO: as this file. Then have them copy and paste the file from Github.
# TITLE: Section 1 - Importing Modules (4 min)

# Take a trip down memory lane and visit Lesson 4R Section 3. There we were introduced to importing
# the "math" module which has some useful functions like pi(), an easier way to find the value of Ï€.
# There is a vast amount of modules that can be used that are natively built in to Python. Let's
# import a built in Python module called "random" that is used to generate random numbers.

# As we mentioned in Lesson 4, imports should generally be at the top of the file. For the sake of
# this lesson though they will be placed throughout the file.
import random

# Let's use the "random()" function. This will generate a random float between 0.0 and 1.0.
# We use dot (.) notation to reference the imported module and then the function from that module.
# You can expect the format of importing to be similar to the following layout: module.function()
rand_float = random.random()
print(rand_float)

# TITLE: Section 1.1 - Importing Specific Funcitons from Modules (5 min)

# In Python, if we only wanted to import a specific function from the "random" module, we can do so
# using the following format:

from random import randrange # This imports the randrange function from the "random" module.

# We do not need to use dot notation anymore to reference our randrange function when importing this
# way. The program can now recognize it originates from the "random" module.

# Let's store a random number between 1 and 10 in a variable called "rand". 

rand = randrange(1,11) # The lower bound is included, but the upper bound is excluded.
rand_plus_two = rand + 2 
print(f"Randomly generated number: {rand}. Here is rand + 2: {rand_plus_two}.")

# TITLE: Section 2 - Importing from Files in your directory (6 min)

# TODO: Hey Teacher, comment out each import before running the file and demonstrate
# TODO: each individually.

# You can import data or functions that you have defined yourself in other files. Let's import 
# importable_stuff.py to use the constants we previously defined in it.
# TIP: Remember constants are indicated by the variable name being presented in all caps.

# As you learned in Section 1, below is the most straight forward way to import a file.
import importable_stuff

# Just as before, you use dot notation to access the constant "DAYS_OF_WEEK" from
# importable_stuff.py. 
print(f"Normal dot notation: {importable_stuff.DAYS_OF_WEEK}")

# You can also rename imports from files just as in Section 1.
import importable_stuff as stuff # Now this import can be referred to going forward as "stuff".
print(f"Renaming as stuff: {stuff.DAYS_OF_WEEK}")

# Similar to Section 1, we can import specific objects from importable_stuff.py. If we wanted to
# specifically import DAYS_OF_WEEK, then we use the following import statement:
from importable_stuff import DAYS_OF_WEEK
print(f"Importing the constant: {DAYS_OF_WEEK}")

# You can also rename the variables and functions imported from files. Below we import the "SEASONS"
# constant and rename it to "SZNS".
from importable_stuff import SEASONS as SZNS
print(f"Importing and renaming the constant: {SZNS}")

# An easy and efficient way to import multiple objects is to separate them by commas.
from importable_stuff import DAYS_OF_WEEK, MONTHS
print(f"{DAYS_OF_WEEK}\n{MONTHS}") # "\n" prints whatever follows on a new line.

# Lastly, there is a way to import all of the contents of a file without needing to use dot
# notation. The syntax to do so is, "from file_name import *".
from importable_stuff import *
print(f"{DAYS_OF_WEEK}\n{MONTHS}\n{SEASONS}")

# TODO: Complete TODO 7 (6 min for students, 2 min for demo)
