# TITLE: Everything in Python is an object.

# TODO: E-1

# Define a function called "uppify()". This function should ask the user "What is your
# favorite color?". Store the users input in a variable called "color".
# Within the function:
#   1. Convert the value of "color" to all uppercase letters and store it in a new variable called
#      "up_color" 
#   2. Print "color" and "up_color" in seperate print statements.
# Lastly, call "uppify()".

# HINT: 1
# The function should not take any parameters.
# HINT: 2
# What method of the string object is used to convert all characters to uppercase?



# TODO: E-2

# Define the class "Computer" with the attributes operating_system, brand, and color. Within the
# class, define a method called printer() that prints the statement, "This computer was manufactured
# by [brand]. It runs on [operating_system] and is [color]."

# HINT: 1
# What function acts as a constructor and is used to assign attributes to a given class?
# HINT: 2
# What parameter should every class method include?


# TODO: E-3

# Create three instances of a "Computer" and store them in the variables, "mac", "pc", "pi".
# The instance stored in "mac" should have the attributes, "macOS", "Apple", "space grey".
# The instance stored in "pc" should have the attributes, "Windows", "Lenovo", "black".
# The instance stored in "pi" should have the attributes, "Raspberry Pi OS", "Raspberry Pi", "black".


# TODO E-4
# Call the printer method for each instance of "Computer" defined in E-3.

# HINT:
# What notation do you use to call a class method.


# TITLE: Discussion/Review

# TODO:
# Is an integer an object in python?

# TODO:
# If integer is an object, does it also use the __init__ constructor. Do all built in objects use
# the __init__ constructor?
