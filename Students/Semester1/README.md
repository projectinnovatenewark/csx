# Day One Doc

### This semester we will be building an internet enabled device (IoT) called "The Fam Cam". It will be a motion detection device that, when triggered, will send a notification to a user's device. This device will be built on a single-board computer with code written in Python that is built on a Linux-based operating system. Since we prepared this course to accommodate all levels of students, we will start assuming the student has no knowledge of programming or  computers. Seeing as we are starting from scratch, we will teach the basics of hardware and computers, operating systems, networking with computers, and programming in Python. Our final project will use a Raspberry Pi for the computer, Raspbian as the Linux-based operating system, and Python for the software needed for the notification system. We look forward to embarking on this journey with you to learning hardware and computer science!

0. We use certain typings that allow us to convey information to the user.

- Text wrapped in backticks `` (they are generally found in the top left of a keyboard along with the tilda "~")
should be directly copied and pasted. For example, `mkdir programming` as shown below would be directly copied and
pasted into your terminal window.

- Text wrapped in square brackets [] are meant to be replaced with text specific to the user. That text will be
described in the brackets. For example, if you wanted to change directories using the "cd" command, you could
enter the following `cd [directory name]`. If that directory was named "py-files", your command would look like
this- `cd py-files`. As you can see, the brackets are removed when you are inserting your own text.

- Text wrapped in double quotes is a reference to some text, or an action that should be taken by the user. These
are typically self-explanatory.
