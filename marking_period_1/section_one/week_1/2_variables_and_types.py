# These lines that start with a pound sign are comments. They do nothing to the program
# except provide instructions, personal notes, or anything that you want really!

# Variables can be thought of as "containers" for a value. These values have types.
# Types include things like integers, strings, floats, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.
# The name of the variable is on the left of the `=` sign and on the right is the content of the variable

# a number without a decimal point is of the type integer
number1 = 5 # integer

# a number with a decimal point is a float
float2 = 6.3 # floating point number
float1 = 7. # also a floating point number

# anything wrapped in quotes is a string
string1 = "Hello" # string over here
string2 = "my name is 29#$%@#$^%" #literally, anything wrapped in quotes is a string
string3 = "369"

# naming variables is important!!! this has a capital "S" in string, so its different
# than the previous variable of string1
String1 = "Wonderful!"

# MULTIPLE VARIABLES IN ONE VARIABLE?! YEP!
big_string = string1 + string2

# Setting multiple variables in one line of code? Also yep. Just make sure you use your commas wisely!
var1, var2, var3 = 1, 2, 3
print(var1, var2, var3)

# Booleans are true or false values. The first letter gets capitalized in the word
boolean = False
boolean2 = True

# print is an example of a function. a function is a block of code that runs when it is called upon.
# the items you place in the parentheses are called arguments
# lets call the print function and pass arguments to print them 
print("printing things, woohoo!!")
print(2387938457)
print(number1)
print(string1)

# You can also "concatenate" strings together below and print multiple strings
print(string1 + " i am python number " + string3 + ", hear me roar!!")

# notice how the spacing is off in the output of big_string?
# thats because variables dont account for spaces! put an extra space in the string to make it neat
print(big_string)
