#### This is a markdown file with the .md file extension (i.e. week_one.md). This is where your lessons will be written in stone for you to review! For more on how to design .md files, check out this link https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

We have some preferences here that we want to make clear to students.

1)  There are two different naming conventions for setting variables file names, etc.
    They are snake_case and camelCase which are shown in their naming. 
    Ex: file_name_in_snake_case vs. fileNameInCamelCase

2)  When we decide what software to use, we go off of what is most popular within the
    computer science industry. For each of the following use cases, we will put what we are
    using first, followed by other popular alternatives. The owner of each respective technology
    will be in parentheses following the software. If it is self owned or open source, there
    will be no label.

    Code editors: VS Code (Microsoft), Atom (Github (owned by Microsoft now)), Sublime (Sublime HQ)
    Version Control Tool: Github (Microsoft), Gitlab (Gitlab), Bitbucket (Atlassian)
    Frontend Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue
    Backend Frameworks: Django
    Cloud Computing: AWS (Amazon), Azure (Microsoft), GCP (Google)
    Database Analysis: DBeaver, Postico (egger apps), Table Plus
    API REST Client: Insomnia, Postman
    Containerization Tool: Docker, VMWare
    Deep Learning: Tensorflow is ML-based, Keras is Neural Networks centric, and PyTorch is for Natural Language Processing

3)  The written code of a specific language is called it's "syntax". As you can see in the many hello worlds folder, there
    are many ways of doing the same task in different programming languages. A good coder can pick up most languages in no time!
    What matters is that you learn the fundamentals of programming- and since Python is one of the most readable and popular
    programming languages of all, that's what we're going to be using in this class!

4)  To run a program in Python 3 using VS Code, navigate to the top right of your VS Code window when in a Python file and click 
    the green arrow which is titled "run python file in your terminal". If you want to open an integrated terminal in your VS Code window,
    simply use 'Shift' + 'Control' + '~' and one will pop right up. The terminal allows you to use a command line. The command line
    is a user interface that is navigated by typing commands at prompts, instead of using the mouse. For example, if you wanted to create
    a folder on your computer, you could navigate to the start panel, open your navigator, and click 'Create New Folder'. But, in the
    command line, you would just type 'mkdir folder-name' and press enter! (PS- mkdir stands for make directory, which is the same
    thing as a folder).

5)  Whether we are describing a terminal/command prompt entry or running through a lesson, we type user inputs the same. If a custom
    item is meant to be input by the user, it'll be denoted as [SOMETHING_HERE]. For example, there is a function called typeof()
    which accepts an input and returns it's type. If we had a program and were writing an example for someone to input whatever they
    wanted, we would type something like `type_assessment = typeof([SOME_INPUT])
