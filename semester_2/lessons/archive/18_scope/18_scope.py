# the 'global' declares that the variable which comes after it is in reference
# to the global variable. global variables exist within the whole file,
# whereas local variables are limited to the scope of a function

# lets toy around with the order of code and test the outcome
# what will this print out and why? It would print out "something"
# because before we call the function, we redeclare the variable 's'
