# Run the code below to find what type of error you are encountering. Then comment out the code and
# rewrite it with a new denominator to fix the error. Then print the type of error you got from the
# original problem.

number = 10 * (1/0) # FIXME

# TODO: Section 1.2:
# Again, run the code below to find what type of error you are encountering. Then define 'spam' on
# the correct line and print the error type you originally received.

equation = 4 + spam * 3 # FIXME

# TODO: Section 1.3:
# Finally, run the code below to find what type of error you are encountering. Change the code so that
# our '2 + 2' addition works and print the error type you originally received.

twotwo = '2' + 2 # FIXME
