# Set a variable to each data type we've learned using the following variable names: fruit,
# day_born, velo, is_wet.

# Your first variable should be a string and equal to your favorite fruit.
# Your second variable should be an integer and equal to the day of the month you were born.
# Your third variable should be a float and equal to the velocity of gravity: 9.8.
# The last variable should be a boolean and set to True or False based on the following
# question: Is water wet?

# In their own print statements, print each variable on its own line.

# TODO: E-2

# Define a variable called first_name equal to your first name. Then print, "Hello my name
# is [first_name]." using f shorthand.

# Next, define another variable called last_name and print a statement similar to the one above,
# but this time using both first_name and last_name.

# Finally create a print statement that includes your first name, last name, and a variable 
# from E-1. EX: "My name is Jon Smith and the velocity of gravity is 9.8 mph."

# TODO: E-3

# Write a python program to convert feet to inches and store the answer in a variable called inches.
# HINT: There are 12 inches in 1 foot.

num_feet = 4

# TODO: E-4

# The print statement below will throw you an error. Revise and uncomment the print statement so you
# can run it without receiving an error. #HINT: Errors in Python are generally descriptive!

three = '3'
# print(f"3 Plus 10 is {three + 10}")
