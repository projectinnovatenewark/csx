<div align=center><h2>Setting up your Raspberry Pi</h2></div>

After unboxing, use the following step-by-step guide to build your Raspberry Pi

1. First we are going to add the heat sinks to the Raspberry Pi (going forward it will be referred to as the Pi). <h3>CAUTION:</h3> When placing them, make sure you are positive when placing the heat sinks because the adhesive is very strong.

    a. As you can see, your Pi comes with 3 heat sinks designed to keep the CPU, RAM, and the USB Controller cool. The picture below labels where each heat sink belongs on the Pi.
    > The USB Controller splits the USB ports to share the same bandwidth and power

    </div>

    b. Place Pi guard #3 as pictured below on the pi to help place the heat sinks on the Pi. Careful handling the guards as they are very fragile!

    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/7_pi_guards.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/3_use_guard_for_sinks.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

    c. After placing the heat sinks on the Pi, you should see the following:
    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/5_pi_with_sinks.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

2. Insert the microSD card into the port on the bottom of the Pi.
    <div class=mdImage align=center>

    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/21_insert_sd.jpeg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

3. Remove the bolts off from the back of the display monitor. Make sure to keep these in a safe spot as they will be needed later.
    
    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/6_remove_washers.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

4. Place Pi guard #1 on the back of the display as shown below:

    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/7_pi_guards.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/8_place_first_guard.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

5. Place the Pi on top of the guard on the back of the display monitor.
    > The ethernet and USB ports should be facing away from the middle of the display.

    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/9_place_pi.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

6. Place the plastic guard (#2) followed by the final guard (#3) on top of the Pi. Then screw each washer back on so that the Pi is secure without too much pressure being on the Pi.
    
    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/10_pi_guard_2.jpg" width="auto" height="300" />
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/11_pi_guard_3.jpg" width="auto" height="300" />
    </div>

7. Below are the USB-C cable and the micro-HDMI cables as well as their corresponding Pi ports.
    a. The USB-C provides power to the Pi.
    b. The micro-HDMI cable is used to display the GUI of the Pi.

    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/12_usbC_and_hdmi.jpg" width="auto" height="250" />
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/13_port_view_of_pi.jpg" width="auto" height="250" />
    </div>

8. Plug in the USB-C into the display and then into the Pi as shown below:

    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/14_plug_in_usbC_in_disp.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/15_plug_in_usbC_in_pi.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

9. Repeat step 9 for the micro-HDMI cable as shown below:

    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/16_plug_hdmi_display.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/17_plug_hdmi_pi.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

10. Below is the power supply chord for the display which in turn also provides power for the Pi. Plug in to the display and a wall outlet to get started for the next section.

    <div class=mdImage align=center>
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/18_power.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    <img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/20_plug_in_power.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
    </div>

<div align=center><h2>Installing Raspbian/Rasperry Pi OS & VS Code</h2></div>

Power on your Raspberry Pi by holding the power button on the back of your monitor for about 5 seconds. 

<div class=mdImage align=center>
<img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/26_power_on.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
</div>

<div align=center><h3>Installing Debian/Raspberry Pi OS</h3></div>

Now that everything is connected and the Pi is powered on, you should see something similar to the following screen:

<div class=mdImage align=center>
<img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/23_installing_rasp_os.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
</div>

11. Setup up your wifi network by selecting the “Wifi networks (w)” button ciricled in the picture belowand follow the steps to connect to your local network.

<div class=mdImage align=center>
<img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/24_wifi_setup.jpeg" width="400" height="auto" />
</div>

12. Select the language at the bottom of the screen to be “English (US)”. Then click on the install button in the top left corner and check the box next to “Raspberry Pi OS FUll (32-bit) (RECOMMENDED)”. Then click the install button in the top left corner again. Now the OS should be installing onto your Raspberry Pi. This should take a few minutes until a popup appears to let you know that the OS has installed successfully.

13. There should be a prompt to update and restart the Raspberry Pi. It is recommended to do so.

<div align=center><h3>Installing VS Code and Git</h3></div>

14. We will be using an open source version of VS Code that is compatible with the Pi. Click the terminal icon in the to left portion of your screen as circled below.

<div class=mdImage align=center>
<img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/27_rasp_term_icon.png" width="400" height="auto" />
</div>

You will see the Raspberry Pi's terminal open. This should look similar to the emulator used in class.

15. In the terminal, execute the following command:

`wget https://packagecloud.io/headmelted/codebuilds/gpgkey -O - | sudo apt-key add -`
> `wget` is a Linux command used to download content from a web server
>
> `sudo` (short for "superuser do") is used when admin privelages are required.
>
> `apt` is for installing, updating, and removing debian packages
>
> `apt-key` is used to help manage and authenticate packages

16. When the previous command is finished; paste the following command and you will see a similar output:

`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/headmelted/codebuilds/master/docs/installers/apt.sh | sudo bash`
> `curl` is used to transfer data to or from a server.
>
> `sudo bash` enters the command at the root directory

All set! If you go to the Raspberry Pi icon in the top left portion of your screen, click accessories and then you will see our code editor.

17. Now let’s install Git in your vs code window. Open VS Code using the Raspberry Pi icon in the top left corner:

<div class=mdImage align=center>
<img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/29_installing_git.png" width="450" height="auto" />
</div>

18. You will see your VS Code window pop up. To open a terminal in your VS Code window, press “ Ctrl + shift + ~”. This will look like the following:

<div class=mdImage align=center>
<img src="./Raspberry_Pi_setup_images/30_installing_git.png" width="500" height="auto" />
</div>

This step requires that you have a Github account. If you have not created one yet, do so <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>. If you already have a Github account feel free to continue.

19. In your terminal, use the following commands to enter your github credentials:
`git config --global user.name “[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]”`
> Whenever you see words in all caps inside brackets like the above, this means to replace it with what the command is asking for.

then:
`git config --global user.email “[YOUR GITHUB ASSOCIATED EMAIL]”`

Now you're all set to clone CSX's repositories to use for the rest of the semester. Happy Coding!
