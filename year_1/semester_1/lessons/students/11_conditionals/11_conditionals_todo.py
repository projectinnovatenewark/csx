# Below are 3 variables, "num1", "num2", and "num3". Use these three variables for the following
# exercises.

num1 = 82
num2 = 100
num3 = -45

# Write a conditional that prints "num1 is greater than num3" if num1 is greater than num3.
# If that condition isn't true, then print "num1 is NOT greater than num3".

# Write a conditional that prints f"{num2} + {num3} is equal to 55" if num2 plus num3 equals 55.
# HINT: There is more than one way to do this. You can use the expression in the conditional or
# HINT: store the expression in a variable and base your condition off of that.

# TODO: Section 2:

# Write a condition that tests if both bool1 AND bool2 are true. If this is true, print, "Everything
# is true". If this condition isn't true, test if either bool1 OR bool2 is True. If so, print, 
# "One of these is true"
# HINT: What conditional can be used to test a specific condition only if the above is false?
bool1 = True
bool2 = False
