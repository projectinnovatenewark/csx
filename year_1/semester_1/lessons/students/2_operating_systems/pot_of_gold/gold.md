# Pot of Gold Exercise

### In this exercise we will learn how to make better use of the command line. We will explore navigating your working directory (directory == folder) with the command line, using a command line interface (CLI) tool, creating/copying/deleting files and folders, finding files and folders based on search filters, replacing the content of files based on filters, displaying and modifying the contents of a file, and working with the Github CLI tool (git) to manage repositories (a directory or storage space where your projects and code can live).

⋅⋅* First, go ahead and download Git here https://git-scm.com/ . Git is a CLI that allows you to work with Github through your command line. We will use this to clone a repository on our computer and, upon finishing the exercise, push up finished code to our own Github account. Make sure to create a Github account if you don't already have one.

⋅⋅* Many of the command line tools we are learning during this exercise are Linux/GNU tools. Lots of the functions like locate, cat, diff, ls, rm, and even the Bash command line's language interpreter are all GNU tools. The GNU project is a compilation of open-sourced (FREE) software that developers have created over many years. The work of these developers over time has contributed to a free and open internet, and thus some form of GNU tools have made their way onto nearly every modern computer.

⋅⋅* The purpose of this exercise is to find the "pot of gold" in our repository. Along the way, we will find some hints and explore the primary tools that you'll need for this semester. Pay attention to the tools used along the way- they will come in handy when the project rolls around!
