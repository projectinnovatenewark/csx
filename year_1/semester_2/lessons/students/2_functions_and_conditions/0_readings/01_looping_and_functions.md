A function is a block of reusable code that is used to perform a specific action. The advantages of using functions are:

-Reducing duplication of code
-Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces
-Improving clarity of the code
-Reuse of code
-Information hiding

Functions in Python are first-class citizens. It means that functions have equal status with other objects in Python. Functions can be
assigned to variables,stored in collections, or passed as arguments. This brings additional flexibility to the language.



Loops are ways to iterate through different data types. They allow us to iterate through items in lists, keys in a dictionary, and
even characters in a string.
