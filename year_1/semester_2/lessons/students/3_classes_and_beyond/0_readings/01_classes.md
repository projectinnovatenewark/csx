So far we have learned about Python's core data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. In this section you will learn about the last major data structure, classes. Classes are quite unlike the other data types, in that they are much more flexible. Classes allow you to define the information and behavior that characterize anything you want to model in your program. (source: http://introtopython.org/classes.html)

For more information to preview classes on your own, check out the section here. Make sure that you don't move on to the Python 2.7 section-
as we will only be using Python 3!
