# TODO: Section 4

# Define a class called "User" that has the public instance attribute "username" and the private
# instance attribute "password". Then define a method within the "User" class called
# "check_password()" that will take an input with the question reading "What is the password?: ".
# The method should compare the input to the password defined in the instantiation of the "User"
# class. If the passwords match, then the method should print "The password entered is correct."
# If the passwords do not match, the method should print the statement "The password entered is
# incorrect."



# Next define an instantiation of the "User" class with "username" equal to "cool_coder" and
# password equal to "abcd1234!" and store it in the variable "user_1". Then call the
# "check_password()" method.



# Lastly, try to print the "password" variable directly. If you receive an error, consider the
# reasoning behind this output.
