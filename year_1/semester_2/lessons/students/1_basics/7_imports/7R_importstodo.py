# TODO: Hey Teacher, have the students create their own "interest.py" within the same folder as this
# TODO: file. Then have them copy and paste the file from Github.

# INSERT IMPORT STATEMENT HERE # FIXME

# TODO: Section 1.1

# Import the "annual_interest" variable and the "TAX_RATE" constant from the file "interest.py".

# Ask the end user how much they would like to invest using the input function. Set it equal to a
# variable named "investment".
# HINT: What data type is "investment"? Can you perform mathematical operations on this data type?

# Calculate how much their investment would appreciate in one year by multiplying the investment
# variable by "annual_interest". Set the appreciation amount equal to a variable
# named "appreciation".

# TODO: Section 1.2

# Create a new variable named "new_value" set to the sum of "appreciation" and "investment".
# Find the sum of "appreciation" and "investment".

# Calculate the taxes you have to pay by setting a variable of "taxes" equal to the "appreciation"
# variable multiplied by the "TAX_RATE".

# Finally, print the following output using f shorthand: "Your investment of [investment] is now worth
# [new_value] and you owe [taxes] in taxes."
