Now that you've got a terminal window up on your VS Code, let's figure out how to use this tool ðŸ”¨

Here are some commands to get going.

TODO: Start by typing in 'pwd' and press enter. PWD stands for path in working directory. That will
      show you the current 'path' of your terminal. If you're in your user, that's a good place to start.

<!-- ! This will show you all of the contents within your path. -->

TODO: Click 'dir' and press enter. This stands for directory. If you're in your username's path, you
      might see things like 'Documents', 'Desktop', 'Pictures', etc.

<!-- ! Let's switch our path to the Desktop so we can create a folder and place it on the Desktop. -->

TODO: To switch into Desktop, type 'cd Desktop' and press enter. If you were to type pwd and press enter
      again, it should reflect the new path and the line will end with Desktop.

<!-- ! You can also go 'up' a level. Let's go back up to the user directory -->

TODO: Type in 'cd ..' and re-enter 'pwd'. Your new directory should be back up in the user space.
      Go back into the desktop again with 'cd Desktop.

<!-- ! Now we will make a folder of our own and create new files in it -->

TODO: Write out 'mkdir python-work' when your path is in Desktop. This will create a folder on
      your desktop called python-work once you press enter. Use 'cd python-work'. You're now in
      that new folder. Enter 'touch hello_world.py' within the terminal and an empty file
      called hello_world.py will be made. Files that end with .py indicate that this is a 
      python file. These documents that end in .md are 'markdown' files, Javascript files
      end in .js, etc. You will see some more examples in the 'many hello worlds' folder.

In VS Code, click the open folder. Navigate over to your python-work folder in Desktop and open
the entire folder. You should see an empty python file. And so begins our journey ðŸš€

         Github after week one is done! Remember, this code can help you get a job ðŸ’°
