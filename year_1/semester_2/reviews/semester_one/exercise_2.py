# FIXME: #1 Write import statement here


# TODO: E-1

# To begin this section, import "pi" *from* the "math" package in FIXME: #1.

# Below is a function called "findArea1()". Inside it, write some code that will find the area of a
# circle. The user should be able to input the value of "r" (the circle's radius). Your function
# should lastly print the statement, "The area of a circle with a radius of [r] is [area]." using
# f shorthand.
 
# TIP:
# The equation for finding the area of a circle is πr² = area.

def findArea1():
  pass # FIXME: Delete this. "pass" is used in python to ignore the function when nothing is in it.

# TODO: E-2

# Next create a new function called "findArea2()" that finds the area of a circle, but this time
# takes the radius as a parameter instead of a user input. Then, if the area is larger than 10,
# print, "This is a large circle." Otherwise print, "This circle isn't that impressive."

# TODO: E-3

# Lastly create a function called "findArea3()" to find the radius of a circle, but this time return
# the value of its area. Again, the function should take "radius" as a paremeter. Then create a
# seperate function called "printer()" that calls "findArea()" and prints its return value in the
# statement, "The area of the new circle is [area]." The radius should again be passed as an
# argument to the "findArea()" function.

# HINT:
# How can we store the value of an executed function?
