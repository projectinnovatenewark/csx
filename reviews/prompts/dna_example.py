"""Reading a DNA sequence from a text file"""

# TODO: A base pair is two chemical bases bonded to one another forming a
# TODO: "rung of the DNA ladder." The DNA molecule consists of two strands
# TODO: that wind around each other like a twisted ladder. Each strand has
# TODO: a backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate
# TODO: groups. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases--adenine (A),
# TODO: cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). The two strands are held
# TODO: together by hydrogen bonds between the bases, with adenine forming
# TODO: a base pair with thymine, and cytosine forming a base pair with guanine.
# TODO: In dna.txt, we have a 1000 character dna sequence. In this todo, you
# TODO: will open the txt file, extract the data, and calculate the number
# TODO: of occurrences for each of the bases- adenine, cytosine, guanine,
# TODO: and thymine.

# TODO: Now, write a new line for each of these bases and
# TODO: their counts to the new file. Each new line in the file should read
# TODO: "[base name here] occurs [number here] times in the DNA sequence".

# TODO: Then, read the txt file line-by-line and print it to the terminal.

# TODO: Close the file, which is standard to do once you are finished using
# TODO: a .txt file.
