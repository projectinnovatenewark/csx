# TODO: Set a variable called name equal to your name, then set a variable of age
# TODO: equal to your age as an integer. Print a statement with an output of
# TODO: `My name is _____ and I am ______ years old.` First, try doing this using
# TODO: "+" to combine your variables and the strings, then print the result.

name = "francine"
age = 26
#print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.")

# Lesson Learned:
# This should throw you a fun error, because concatenation can only be done with
# strings, not strings and integers/floats. Commas, however, simply print 
# separate elements rather than attempting to concatenate strings.

# TODO: Let's use commas to print our desired output instead. Refer to the output
# TODO: above of `My name is _____ and I am ______ years old.`

print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")

# TODO: Set a variable equal to the float `1.0`, then set another variable of
# TODO: `futureAge` equal to the age variable plus the variable you set equal to 1.0
# TODO: Print a statement of `Next year, I will be ____ years old`.

variable = 1.0
age = 26
futureAge = age + variable
print("Next year, I will be", futureAge, "years old.")

# Lesson Learned:
# You can see that adding a float to an integer makes the result a float!

# TODO: Set a variable equal to each of the types we have learned so far. That includes
# TODO: integers, floats, booleans, None, and strings. So, have one variable per each
# TODO: of those types (i.e. exampleInt = 0, exampleBool = False, etc.).
# TODO: To check the type of something in python, you use the type() function.
# TODO: For example, type("Hello") would yield string, and type(6) would yield int.
# TODO: So, create on print statement that would print the type of each variable you've set.

number = 1
print(type(1))
decimal = 1.0
print(type(1.0))
theTruth = True
print(type(True))
noWhere = None
print(type(None))
stringCheese = "Hello"
print(type("Hello"))

# Lesson Learned:
# Types are important in Python and you can check different elements' types using type().
# The type() function is an example of a polymorphic function, meaning that the same
# function name can be used for different types. BIG. WORDS. GET. YOU. JOBS. üí∞

# TODO: Lastly, we will introduce type conversion. There are functions you can use to 
# TODO: convert things in Python. The first we will use is str(). Try the first
# TODO: step instructed of using plus signs to concatenate strings to print 
# TODO: `My name is _____ and I am ______ years old.` using the name and age variables.
# TODO: However, this time when you're concatenating the age variable, wrap it in the
# TODO: str() function as such: str(age). The print statement will no longer throw an
# TODO: error üéØ since age was converted to a string.

print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
# Lesson Learned:
# We can change types in Python when appropriate, and we learned one way to do so with str()

# Good job, guys! First todo down üí™üèæ
