Solve the classic fizz buzz problem

# TODO: Write a function that sets a number "n" as a parameter. If the number is a multiple of 3,
# TODO: print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead
# TODO: of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of
# TODO: the number. If neither of those scenarios apply, simply print the number that was passed as
# TODO: an argument.

# TODO: Call the fizzBuzz function for every number between 1 and 100 using a for loop and
# TODO: the range function.
