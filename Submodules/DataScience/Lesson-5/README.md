# Intro to Machine Learning 

In this lesson, we'll be taking a deep dive into the world of Machine Learning. As an important branch of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning is all about crafting algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make informed predictions or decisions without the need for explicit programming. We'll be exploring the three fundamental steps of machine learning - acquiring the data, training a model based on this data, and finally, using the model to make predictions.

Our guide for these lessons will be the widely recognized Iris Dataset, considered the "Hello World" of machine learning. This dataset contains measurements of different features of Iris flowers across three distinct species. We'll be using sklearn's pre-loaded datasets to load the Iris Dataset, converting it to a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation, and carrying out basic exploratory data analysis. We will delve into the concept of Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning and how training data looks in each of those categories. In this case, our training data will have **labels** of the species of Iris flowers, making it a Supervised Machine Learning Model. We'll go through the process of splitting our data into training + testing sets, and using a Logistic Regression model for classifying the flowers based on their features. Lastly, we will evaluate the performance of our model using a Confusion Matrix and calculate important metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. By the end of these lessons, you will gain an understanding of how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model, offering you a strong foothold in the world of machine learning.
