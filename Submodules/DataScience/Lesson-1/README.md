# Python and SQL

In this lesson we will learn how to execute SQL queries. This will include creating a database, defining some tables, and performing CRUD operations on data.

To start, you should fork off of this [repl](https://replit.com/@Christiantav/db-lesson?v=1). It will include the python package you need (sqlalchemy) to run the code in this lesson.

Then, you have the option to either define a database on your computer or use a repl database. For students, we recommend setting up a repl database as most school-issued computers won't allow you to install programs like Docker. If you are a student, please follow the documentation on repl [here](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/databases/postgresql-on-replit#setup) and do not continue past the "Setup" section. The remaining steps will be detailed in the lesson. Do note, however, that if the database name is referenced in the lesson, you will have to substitute your database's name with the lesson's database name.
