    "## What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Deep learning__ is a subfield of __artificial intelligence__ (AI) and __machine learning__ that focuses on building and training artificial __neural networks__ to perform complex tasks. It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, where multiple layers of interconnected __neurons__ work together to process information and make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *deep* in deep learning refers to the architecture of these neural networks, which typically consist of multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. Each hidden layer processes and transforms the data in a hierarchical manner, allowing the network to learn increasingly abstract representations of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of training a *deep learning model* involves feeding it a large dataset with *input-output* pairs and adjusting the weights and biases (refer back to Lessons 6 and 7 for what weights and biases are) of the neural network through an optimization algorithm to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual outputs. This iterative optimization process helps the network learn to recognize patterns, make predictions, classify objects, or perform other complex tasks."

    "### Why is Deep Learning Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is essentially a more optimized version of classical Machine Learning. With *classical* Machine Learning, you typically  select, design, and transform relevant features from raw data to make it suitable for the learning algorithm in a process known as __Feature Engineering__. This process requires domain expertise and can be time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, deep learning models, particularly deep neural networks, learn to automatically extract relevant features and representations directly from raw data during the training process. This is achieved through the use of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, which learn to transform the input data at each layer into more abstract representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning has other benefits such as the model being able to handle large datasets, the model being able to be trained end-to-end without complex intermediate steps, and more. It is crucial to note that there are specific use cases for both Deep Learning and classical Machine Learning."
