# Statistical Analysis and Visualization

To start, you should fork off of this [repl](https://replit.com/@Christiantav/data-science-pandas?v=1). It will include the python packages you need (pandas and others) to run the code in this lesson.

Today we will be learning the fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and analyzing data sets to understand their main characteristics, patterns, and relationships. It involves using statistical and visualization techniques to gain insights into the data, identify outliers or missing values, and determine the most appropriate methods for further analysis. EDA is typically conducted at the beginning of a data analysis project to better understand the data before applying any modeling or hypothesis testing.

In this lesson, we will explore the importance of EDA, delve intov descriptive statistics and summary metrics, and learn techniques for distribution analysis and visualization.
