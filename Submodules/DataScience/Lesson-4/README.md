# Exploratory Data Analysis & Time Series analysis

To start, you should open up  this github [git](https://github.com/projectinnovatenewark/csx/tree/main/Submodules/DataScience/Lesson-2) and download the nessessary files. This includes `students_performance.csv` which you will be using to execute our functions. You will be copy pasting the lesson as we go through it in Google Colab.

Todya we will be going over the basics of exploratory data analysis which will build upon the past lessons. This means we will be extroplating the statistical information extracted from the `.csv` files and seeing what further aid they can provide when effectively analysing a dataset. 

Today we will continue to use google colab and run each module seperately. Remember to run the code and change the inputs to see what effect it has on the data and the graph.
