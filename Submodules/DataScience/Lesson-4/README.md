To start, you should open up this github [git] (https://github.com/projectinnovatenewark/csx/tree/main/Submodules/DataScience/Lesson-4) and download the nessessary files. These are the files we will be using to execture our functions. You will be copy and pasting the lesson into your google colab as we go through it in class. 

Today, we will delve into three essential topics: Time Series Analysis, Scikit-learn (a Python machine learning library), and Relationship and Correlation Analysis. Time Series Analysis focuses on studying data points collected over time, helping us recognize patterns and trends in temporal data. This is vital for forecasting future values and understanding seasonality or cyclical patterns. Scikit-learn, on the other hand, is a powerful tool that empowers data scientists with an extensive set of machine learning algorithms and tools. From classification to regression, Scikit-learn streamlines the process of building predictive models and makes it accessible to all. Lastly, Relationship and Correlation Analysis are essential techniques in data exploration. By examining the connections between variables, we gain insights into their dependencies, strengths, and directions, facilitating more informed decision-making in data-driven projects. With these crucial concepts in mind, we can now embark on our journey to uncover valuable knowledge from data through Exploratory Data Analysis.
