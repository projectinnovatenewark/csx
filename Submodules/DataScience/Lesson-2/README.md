# Data with Pandas

To start, you should open up this github [git](https://github.com/projectinnovatenewark/csx/tree/main/Submodules/DataScience/Lesson-2) and download the nessessary files. This includes `pokemon_data.csv` and `filtered.csv` which you will be using to execute our functions. You will be copy pasting the lesson as we go through it in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). Colab is a feature similar to jupyter, colab is an online note book where you can run your code and see the reults as they happen. To add the `.csv` files you have just added you will need to drop them in the left side of the screen where you will see a folder graphic.

Today we will go over the basics of pandas. This involves loading data, sorting data, aggregating data, as well as performing other functions to the dataset. All the TO-DO sections are in red text and are useful in better understanding the content. 

Before today's lesson, please watch this video on using Colab. Enjoy!(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI)
