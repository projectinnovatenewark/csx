# Data with Pandas

To start, you should open up this github [git](https://github.com/projectinnovatenewark/csx/tree/main/Submodules/DataScience/Lesson-2) and download the nessessary files. This includes `pokemon_data.csv` which you will be using to execute our functions. You will be copy pasting the lesson as we go through it in Google Colab.

Today we will go over the basics of pandas. This involves loading data, sorting data, aggregating data, as well as performing other functions to the dataset. All the TO-DO sections are in red text and are useful in better understanding the content.

Before today's lesson, please watch this video on using Colab. Enjoy!(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI)
